# General info on numbers of calls:

# Sensitivity+false positive rate per cell
# -------- SNV ---------- | --------- Indel ----------
#    a) demonstrate actual sensitivity
#       XXX: this is not a good sensitivity estimate. it's the middle 50% depth
#            so that extrapolation to total burden is accurate.
#       INSTEAD: use the raw fraction of germline hSNPs called
#    b) "scaling factor" for burden estimation
#       - is it better to say that there is no single scaling factor?
#       - scaling factor is: results@mutburden$snv$callable.sens[2]
#             B/Gbp = (muts called) / (callable.sens) / (callable.bp*2) * 1e9,
#         where all values above are for the middle 50% of depth
#    c) sens, FDR model from PTA paper
#       - model is:
#             FDR = F / (F + xS), where
#         * S is measured sensitivity
#         * x is mutation burden (callable?)
#         * F is pass or rescue FP measurement from synthetic X diploids
#               F_pass = 0.004587832
#               S_pass = 0.2535238   (might not use this, observed sens is 38.03% neurons)
#               F_resc = 0.01313788
#               S_resc = 0.4730635   (same as above, optimistic estimate is 50.35%)
#               ---------- Indels ----------
#               F_pass = 0 (0.0009384202 when all 63 spikeins used)
#                  -> note in rebuttal that this is consistent with near-0 indel calls from infant PTA
#               F_resc = 0.0007298824 (0.002606723 all 63 spikeins)
#       - note to me: /home/ljl11/ndata1/pta/figures/suppfig_sccaller_monovar
#    d) possible: worst-case FDR model "y-intercept is uniform FP rate"

# Effect of rescue (in this case, just sens+FP estimates. reviewer probably also wants effect on enrichment)
