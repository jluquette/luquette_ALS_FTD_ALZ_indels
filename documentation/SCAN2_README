CONFIGURING THIS PIPELINE
=========================
Users must edit snakemake/snakefile.scan2_call_mutations to adapt to their compute
infrastructures.  The default values will almost certainly not work.  The relevant
lines to edit are lines 8-9 below.

1   shell:
2       # Very intentionally not putting --drmaa or --snakemake-args as Snakemake params.
3       # Changing these do not change results, but Snakemake may want to rerun jobs
4       # if the params ever did change.
5       """
6       {input.scan2_bin} -d {input.scan2_output_dir} --snakefile {input.scan2_snakefile} \
7           run \
8               --joblimit 400 \
9               --drmaa ' -p park -A park_contrib -c {{threads}} --mem={{resources.mem_mb}} -t 24:00:00 -o %logdir/slurm-%A.log' \
10              --snakemake-args ' --restart-times=2 --rerun-triggers=mtime --keep-going --max-status-checks-per-second 0.5 --max-jobs-per-second 2 --rerun-incomplete'
11      """

* --joblimit 400 sets the maximum number of jobs EACH SCAN2 RUN MAY USE.  There are
  currently 20 SCAN2 runs that will be run simultaneously.
* --drmaa passes its argument through to Snakemake's --drmaa.  See the Snakemake docs
  for instructions on setting an appropriate DRMAA string.  If you choose to use DRMAA,
  you will need to install a separate slurm-drmaa package.  Some systems may have this
  available already via, e.g., `module load slurm-drmaa`.  Note that the Snakemake
  developers now recommend against --drmaa, instead recommending --cluster.  Currently,
  Snakemake's --slurm option SHOULD NOT be used as it seems to randomly reduce certain
  jobs' thread counts to 1, resulting in jobs that can take a month or longer.
  When adapting our --drmaa flag to another infrastructure, take care to use the
  {{threads}} and {{resources.mem_mb}} parameters, as these are (somewhat) tuned for
  each job to be reasonable.



SCAN2 RESOURCE FILES
====================

Users should follow the installation instructions at https://github.com/parklab/SCAN2 for
genome version hs37d5.  However, some amount of this is handled in Snakemake.  Exceptions
that must be handled by the user are noted here.


SCAN2
=====
* The SCAN2 pipeline package (https://github.com/parklab/SCAN2) is fully automatic.
* The SCAN2 R package (https://github.com/parklab/r-scan2) must be installed by the
  user.  The correct commit ID is recorded in snakemake/Snakefile.scan2 and automates
  the download and install.  The user must take care not to overwrite this installed
  r-scan2 version (e.g., even if conda really wants to).  If the version is overwritten,
  it can be reinstalled by running:
        cd scan2/r-scan2_specific_commit
        R CMD INSTALL --build .
  N.B. as all things in this pipeline, the conda environment must be `conda activate`d
  before running R CMD INSTALL --build ., or else the R package will be installed to
  the wrong R library.


HUMAN REFERENCE
===============
Fully automatic.


SIGPROFILERMATRIXGENERATOR REFERENCE
====================================
No automation. User must follow instructions at https://github.com/parklab/SCAN2. Briefly,
with the conda environment active, start python and run the commands:
    python
        from SigProfilerMatrixGenerator import install as genInstall
        genInstall.install('GRCh37', rsync=False, bash=True)
        quit()


SHAPEIT PHASING REFERENCE PANEL
===============================
Fully automatic.


DBSNP
=====
As of 05/31/2023, I do not think the exact version of dbSNP we use (v147 b37 common_all) is
available for download. It has to be created by downloading a newer version and filtering
for sites in version 147 or lower.

So for the current analysis, I've simply manually copied over our dbsnp147_b37_common_all
VCF and associated indexes (.idx) and gzipped version (.gz, .gz.idx).  Any future user of
this pipeline will need to do the same and name the files as expected by Snakemake:

66402bc8fcfc0be8070ff12ad996f915  resources/dbsnp_147_b37_common_all_20160601.vcf
a1b77a1704d1b4b6be6a884b99529dbc  resources/dbsnp_147_b37_common_all_20160601.vcf.gz
96bd7355661911f3165d69dd5bfc16a3  resources/dbsnp_147_b37_common_all_20160601.vcf.gz.tbi
42f0fd58a5f787467e817c112e99064f  resources/dbsnp_147_b37_common_all_20160601.vcf.idx

The above md5sums may not be correct since newer dbSNP versions may have different
headers or different INFO fields.
