There are a few files that cannot be downloaded automatically, either for
privacy reasons (ICGC) or technical issues (some supplementary tables of
published articles).

The user must download these manually and place them in certain expected
locations.

1. ICGC.  Samples included in ICGC from TCGA are protected. See documentation/CANCER_README.

2. [AUTOMATED] Supplementary Table 5 from Nott et al., Science.  The table is located here:
        https://www.science.org/doi/suppl/10.1126/science.aay0793/suppl_file/aay0793-nott-table-s5.xlsx
   and must be placed in
        data/nott/SupplementaryTable5.xlsx

   This table is now distributed with this pipeline in external_data/aay0793-nott-table-s5.xlsx
   and will be copied into the correct location automatically.

3. single cell ATAC-seq data: annotated UMAP coordinate table and raw fragments file:
        scatacseq/fragments.tsv
        scatacseq/umap.csv

4. single cell RNA-seq data: annotated UMAP table and mean expression matrix:
        scrnaseq/snRNA_1465a_table.csv  [UPDATE: THIS WILL CHANGE WHEN 4638/4643 ARE INTEGRATED]
        scrnaseq/combined_mean_expr.csv
