Installing Arial:

conda: r-extrafont, r-svglite, mscorefonts

run in R:
library(extrafont)
library(remotes)
# i had to run the line below twice; first time said 1.3.8 was invalid, second worked for some reason
remotes::install_version("Rttf2pt1", version = "1.3.8")
remotes::install_version("Rttf2pt1", version = "1.3.8")

# RESTART R (maybe don't need to load extrafont before install_version - but I haven't tested.
# Loading extrafont above imports a newer version of Rttf2pt1, which fails on
# font extraction. The older version can't replace the newer version; i.e,
# > library(Rttf2pt1)
# Error in value[[3L]](cond) : 
#  Package 'Rttf2pt1' version 1.3.10 cannot be unloaded:
# Error in unloadNamespace(package) : namespace 'Rttf2pt1' is imported by 'extrafont' so cannot be unloaded
font_import(paths="path/to/env/pkgs/mscorefonts-0.0.1-3/fonts/")


now check:
'Arial' %in% fonts()
