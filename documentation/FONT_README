Installing Arial:

conda: extrafont, svglite, mscorefonts

run in R:
library(extrafont)
library(remote)
# i had to run the line below twice; first time said 1.3.8 was invalid, second worked for some reason
remotes::install_version("Rttf2pt1", version = "1.3.8")
remotes::install_version("Rttf2pt1", version = "1.3.8")
font_import(paths="path/to/env/pkgs/mscorefonts-0.0.1-3/fonts/")


now check:
'Arial' %in% fonts()
