Aligned and processed BAM files must be downloaded from dbGaP, project
phs001485.v4.

There are 183 BAMs in total, with each corresponding to a sample ID in
metadata/panel_metadata_162cells_66ptaols_40mdaglia_56ptaneurons_21bulks_20brains.csv.

These BAMs and their indexes must be saved in the bams/ directory and be
named following the convention:
    bams/{sample_ID}.bam
    bams/{sample_ID}.bai

This naming convention may not be upheld by dbGaP, so the user must ensure
proper file naming.
