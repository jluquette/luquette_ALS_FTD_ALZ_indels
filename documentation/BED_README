Very important for any future use of this pipeline:

bedenrich.R does *NOT* require that BED intervals are disjoint *even within a
specific record class*. This means mutations can be incorrectly double counted
if multiple records from the same class overlap.

It just so happens to be the case that none of the 4 non-QBEDs used in this
pipeline have overlapping intervals within a class, so this behavior causes
no issues in our analysis.

For example, running these mutations

   chr    pos refnt altnt
1:   1 853262     C     G
2:   1 930822     A     G

and this BED file

chr1    800000  900000  classA
chr1    810000  910000  classA
chr1    820000  920000  classA
chr1    830000  930000  classB
chr1    840000  940000  classA
chr1    850000  950000  classB
chr1    850001  950002  classB
chr1    850002  950003  classC
chr1    850003  950004  classC
chr1    850004  950005  classA
chr1    850005  950006  classB
chr1    990000  991000  classA

through bedenrich.R produces these counts:

        obs
classA    7
classB    7
classC    4

because the first mutation intersects with all but the last record
(n=5 classA, n=4 classB, n=2 classC) and the second mutation intersects
with all but the first 4 and last record (n=2 classA, n=3 classB, n=2 classC)
for the totals reported above.

Of course, the same mis-counting will be applied to permutations.  So it is
unclear how large of an effect this would have if, in future analyses, an
improper BED is used.  The effect size would depend on how far from uniform
the mutation detection sensitivity is in the region vs. outside of the region.
