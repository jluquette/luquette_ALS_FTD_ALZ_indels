Cancer somatic mutations come from the ICGC portal:

https://dcc.icgc.org/releases/PCAWG/consensus_snv_indel

The ICGC public MAF file is directly downloadable from 

https://dcc.icgc.org/api/v1/download?fn=/PCAWG/consensus_snv_indel/final_consensus_passonly.snv_mnv_indel.icgc.public.maf.gz

but the TCGA MAF file is protected. The user must download this file manually (via the following command, copied from the above web portal). The file must then be listed in manifests/INPUT_MANIFEST on the "cancer_tcga" line.

aws --profile pdc --endpoint-url https://bionimbus-objstore-cs.opensciencedatacloud.org s3 cp s3://pcawg-tcga/consensus_snv_indel/final_consensus_passonly.snv_mnv_indel.tcga.controlled.maf.gz
