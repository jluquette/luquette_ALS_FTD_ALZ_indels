Creating PCAWG metadata:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file metadata/pcawg_metadata.csv used to be created in the pipeline. But then
the pipeline needed to be able to read it to generate rules. So it was generated and
added to the code repo.

The code to create the file is still in the pipeline and can be rerun if desired.
Simply comment out all references to the python object pcawg_metadata in snakefile.data
and run snakemake -s snakemake/Snakefile --until metadata/pcawg_metadata.csv.


Data sources
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cancer somatic mutations come from the ICGC portal:

https://dcc.icgc.org/releases/PCAWG/consensus_snv_indel

The ICGC public MAF file is directly downloadable from 

https://dcc.icgc.org/api/v1/download?fn=/PCAWG/consensus_snv_indel/final_consensus_passonly.snv_mnv_indel.icgc.public.maf.gz

but the TCGA MAF file is protected. The user must download this file manually (via the following command, copied from the above web portal). The file must then be listed in manifests/INPUT_MANIFEST on the "cancer_tcga" line.

aws --profile pdc --endpoint-url https://bionimbus-objstore-cs.opensciencedatacloud.org s3 cp s3://pcawg-tcga/consensus_snv_indel/final_consensus_passonly.snv_mnv_indel.tcga.controlled.maf.gz
