snRNA_1465a.rds - used for supp. fig 1. purpose: multiple sorts of the same brain to show
    what cell types are recovered by the various sorting strategies.

    N.B. the current snRNA_1465a.rds object does not appear to contain a tSNE reduction.
    Must be applied.


All.Aggr.renamed.rds - used for main figure 4 UMAP plots. purpose: contains all snRNA-seq
    data used in this study.

The rds_to_csv.R script was used to convert All.Aggr.renamed.rds into a table of UMAP
coords.  It could be used in principle to generate 1465_table.csv, but wasn't.
